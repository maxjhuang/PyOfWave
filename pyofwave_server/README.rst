PyOfWave Server
===============

PyOfWave Server is the service which stores, updates, and retrieves. It is the more technical side and must be ran by Wave Providers to provide Wave services. 

It provides a small, efficient, and flexible XMPP-powered code base which is customizable by a Django derived settings system and Python scripts (adaptors). 

We also plan to "integrate" into existing protocols (SMTP, RSS, XMPP IM "Jabber") so users don't have to wait for everyone else to use Wave before using it themselves.
