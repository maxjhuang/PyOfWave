PyOfWave Client
===============

PyOfWave Client is the major web-based Wave UI for Wave Providers to embed in their site. It follows guidelines of GNOME, Apple, and Edwarde Tufte to create a user friendly UI through User Centered Design, with full keyboard accessibility.

It builds upon a custom engine (an XML builder, data access, & bindings system) which transforms our XML between our Model, View, & Controller and aims to:

- Be User Friendly :-|)
- Keyboard Accessible
- Small footprint
- Cross browser
- i18n-ized
- Embeddable and themable
